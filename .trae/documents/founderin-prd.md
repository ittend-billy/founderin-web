## 1. Product Overview

Founderin is a Founder-to-Market Architecture firm that transforms brilliant Japanese technical founders from invisible builders into companies the world can understand, trust, and back. We design the missing layer between founder's product and market through category design, user clarity, founder narrative, pitch architecture, and external voice systems.

Target audience: Technical founders in Japan building strong products but struggling with growth, user acquisition, and global expansion. They're product-first, introverted, brilliant but bad at explaining value, and skeptical of traditional marketing approaches.
